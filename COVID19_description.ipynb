That's why is important to analyze data that we have and to see where the situation is really difficult where it just starts to be difficult. How quarantine impacts on number of disease cases etc.\n\n![Corona virus](https://thumb.tildacdn.com/tild3433-3466-4162-a636-313033393538/-/resize/440x/-/format/webp/coronavirus-02---.jpg)\n\nThe virus, which causes a pneumonia-like disease called COVID-19 and has so far killed more than 160000 people worldwide, quickly burst through national borders. The coronavirus COVID-19 is affecting 210 countries and territories around the world. On this day (20th April 2020) 2,431,390 cases of the disease were detected. There are 1627721currently infected patients and 3% of them are in serious or critical condition. There are also 803 669 cases that had an outcome and 21% from them are deaths.\nThis pandemic is a global problem. And no other idea is important like stop spreading COVID-19. That's why I decided to analyze data connected with COVID-19.\n\nWith the rapid spread in the novel corona-virus across countries, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and several organizations have published the latest results on the impact of COVID-19 over the past few months.\n\n![](https://followers.com.ua/coronavirus/covid19-act-now/covid19-map-1.min.png)"

The number of cases on any given day is the cumulative number.\n\nAlso I used demographic data for calculating number of cases per million."
